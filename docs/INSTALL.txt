Installation
============

 * Add ``collective.collage.contentleadimage`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.collage.contentleadimage

  * If you're using a version of Plone earlier than 3.3, tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        collective.collage.blogging
