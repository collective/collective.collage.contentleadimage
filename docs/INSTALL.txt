Installation
============

* Add ``collective.collage.contentleadimage`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

::

   [buildout]
   ...
   eggs =
      collective.collage.contentleadimage

* If you're using a version of Plone earlier than 3.3, tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

::

   [instance]
   recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
   ...
   zcml =
      ...
      collective.collage.blogging
