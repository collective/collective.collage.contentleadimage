Introduction
============

a Collage environment, in a Plone site.  

The typical *Summary* view for a Folder or a Collection only displays 
images for News Items, the only default type that images can be assigned 
to.  This package uses the existing 'Folder lead-image view' provided by

Folders and Collections (Topics) can have this new Collage view applied to
them.
